# BIS 572 - Week 2 Lecture 1 Notes


## Cybersecurity Risk

Risk Assessment should guide:
- Control implementations
- Resource allocation
- Incident response preparedness

You can either start with organizations goals and missions (top down) or start with systems and vulneribilites (bottom up)

**Risk Related Definitions**

- **Risk**: Combines probability of an event and its consequence.
- **Threat**: Anything (e.g., object, substance, human) that is capable of acting against an assetin a manner that can result in harm. Broadly, a potential cause of an unwanted incident.
- **Asset:** Something worth protecting, including people, information, infrastructure, finances and reputation
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness in the design, implementation, operation or internal control of a process that could expose the system to adverse threats from threat events.
- **Inherent risk:** The risk level or exposure without taking into account the actions that management has taken or might take (e.g., implementing controls)
- **Residual risk:** Even after safeguards are in place, there will always be residual risk, defined as the remaining risk after management has implemented a risk response.

**Key Frameworks**

- **ISO**: International Organization of Standardization
- **ISACA**: Information Systems Audit and Control Association
- **ICE**: Internatinoal Electrontechial Commission
- **NIST**: National Instutute of Standards and Technology

---

**Thinking about Risk**
- Liklihood/probability and impact/consequences
- Assessments factors for risk measurement
- Considering third-party risk
- Approaches for risk management

---

**Making sense of Risk**
- **Impact**: What is the organizational consequence?
- **Likelihood**: How likley is it to happen in a time period (probability)
    - **Vulnerability**: What makes the attack possible
    - **Threat**: What can act aginst our assests
        - **Capability**: What knowldege/skills are needed to carry out the threat
        - **Opporunity**: What resources does an attacker need to attack
        - **Intent**: Why would the attacker attack? What would they gain

---

**Model the Attack**
- **Who**: Attackers, errors, infastructure failures, natural distasters
- **How**: Physical VS Cyber attack, non-adversarial
- **Why**: Oops, intel, political gain, money

**Generic Risk Model From NIST 800-30**

---

**Calculations**

$$\text Likelihood \times \text Impact = \text Exposure$$

**Examples**

10% risk of something happening in a 10 year time window with an impact of $120,000

$$10\% \times \$120,000 = 12,000$$

$12,000 of exposure over the next 10 years.

---

**Risk Mitigations Strategies**
- **Avoidance**: Eliminating the risk entirely by not engaging in the activity that causes it
- **Mitigation**: Taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk
- **Transfer**: Shifting the risk to a third party (insurance)
- **Acceptance**: Acknowledging the risk and choosing to accept it without taking immediate action

--- 

**Cybersecurity Approaches**

- **Ad Hoc (Bad)**: An unstructured, reactive approach to risk or security, where issues are addressed only after they occur  
- **Compliance-based (Inevitable)**: A reactive approach focused on meeting minimum legal or regulatory requirements, often checking boxes without fully addressing real risks
- **Risk-based (Best)**: A proactive, strategic approach that prioritizes actions based on the likelihood and impact of risks, aligning with business objectives for optimal protection
