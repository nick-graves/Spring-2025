## ROE - Return on Equity
$$\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Shareholder Equity}}$$

Tells us how efficiently a company is using its shareholder' equity to generate profit. How much return is earned for every dollar of equity invested by shareholders. Although, it can also bet written as follows:


$$\text{ROE} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Sales}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Net Sales}}{\text{Average Total Assets}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Average Total Assets}}{\text{Average Shareholder Equity}} \right)$$


Or even further simplified to:

$$\text{ROE} = \text{Profit Margin (PM)} \times \text{Asset Turnover (AT)} \times \text{Financial Leverage (FL)}$$

Expanding this formula is referred to as **Dupont Disaggregation**. It provides insight into the driving factors behind the return on equity.
>- **PM**: Measures profitability — how much profit is earned from each dollar of sales
>- **AT**: Measures efficiency — how well assets are used to generate revenue.
>- **FL**: Measures capital structure — how much of the company’s assets are financed by equity vs. debt.

## ROA - Return on Asset

$$\text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Shareholder Assets}}$$


Or expanded via **Dupont Disaggregation** you'll find it's just *PM $\times$ AT* or full expanded to:


$$\text{ROE} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Sales}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Net Sales}}{\text{Average Total Assets}} \right)$$
