3. Your team’s policies.
- Primary mode of communication: Discord will be used for meetings and day-to-day communication, but emails and phone numbers have also been distributed as a backup medium for communication.
- Response timeline: Responses are typically expected within 2 hours during standard business hours (PST). In extenuating circumstances, a response should be provided within 12 hours at the latest.

3. What should a team member do if they...
- Get confused about what to do: Communicate early through one of the provided communication mediums. The communication should discuss the plan to move forward. Whether it be switching around assigned tasks for the week, meeting as a group to clarify the area of confusion, or reaching out to the professor to gain additional insight. 
- Fall behind in their work: The team member should communicate this immediately. Once communicated, the team will decide how to how to get back on track, likely utilizing the same strategies outlined in the "confusion" section. 
- Fail to contribute sufficiently to an assignment: The group member will be expected to make up their lack of contribution on the next assignment. This should be discussed at the earliest convenience of the team but definitely before work begins on the assignment following the failed contribution.
